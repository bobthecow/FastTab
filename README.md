# FastTab plug-in for Coda

![Jump to tabs in Coda with FastTab][img]

A member of the Coda users group requested the ability to jump to tabs with a hotkey — like in Firefox and Chrome — and it sounded like a great idea. So here you go.

FastTab for Coda lets you jump to any tab (up to 9, I guess) by pressing control + the tab number. Enjoy!

## Installation

Double-click to install.
